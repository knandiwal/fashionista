About
=====

Fashionista is an AngularJS based PhoneGap application which allows users to fetch, rate and catalogue Instagram photos with the hashtag **#fashionista** 

The app allows users to rate & reject images from the realtime feed. Positively rated images are saved to the user's upvote section of their profile, where they can be linked to the owner's instagram profile.

Installation
============

The current project targets iOS on PhoneGap 2.9.0 - a PhoneGap Build friendly branch will be created on completion of the iOS branch.
